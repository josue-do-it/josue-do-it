My main research interests revolve around **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** , **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and  **Computer Vision**. I also actively explore **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and advanced deep learning architectures, with a focus on how learning systems make decisions and adapt to complex environments.

I am especially interested in collaborations that connect **research laboratories and industry-driven AI applications**.
