## Hi there 👋

I am currently deepening my expertise in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **advanced deep learning architectures**, with a particular interest in how modern AI systems learn, generalize, and scale. My learning trajectory is guided by research questions that are relevant both to **academic inquiry** and **real-world industrial applications**.
